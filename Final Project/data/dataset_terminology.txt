***TERMINOLOGY OF THE DATASET***

The “constructionyear” indicates the year in which the instrument was completed in its current rendition. 
That is, even though some instruments contain parts from the 16th and 17th centuries, it is possible that the “constructionyear” states a later year (e.g. the organ of Aarhus Domkirke lists 1928, even though the casework is from the 18th century).

“locality” indicates where the organ is placed in Denmark.

“organbuilder” indicates the company that constructed the instrument. 
In the instruction section (“Vejledning”) on orgel.natmus.dk it is stated that the same company may be represented with different names; it is likely that the listed company name of a specific instrument is the name of the company at the time of the completion of the instrument.

“architect” gives the company name of the architectural firm behind the casework of the instrument, if applicable.

“stopsnumber” tells us the amount of stops – those lever-like things the organist pulls out to specify the sound of the instrument. 
It is unclear whether or not the Organ Registrant here also includes stops that doesn’t produce a sound of its own (like couplers or tremulants). 
	
“manualsnumber” lists the amount of manuals – that is, keyboards – on a given instrument.
	
“pedals” specifies whether or not an instrument has a pedalboard. 
If yes, “Pedal” is entered. If not, “(Intet Pedal)” (English: “No Pedal”). 
If the pedal division of the instrument is not independent, “Anhangspedal” (English: “Pull-down Pedal”) is entered.
